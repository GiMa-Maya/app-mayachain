This project contains the MAYAChain app for Ledger Nano S, Nano S+, X, Flex and Stax.

- Ledger Nano S/S+/X/Flex/Stax MAYAChain app
- Specs / Documentation
- C++ unit tests
- Zemu tests

## ATTENTION

Please:

- **Do not use in production**
- **Do not use a Ledger device with funds for development purposes.**
- **Have a separate and marked device that is used ONLY for development and testing**

# Development

## Preconditions

- Be sure you checkout submodules too:

    ```
    git submodule update --init --recursive
    ```

- Install Docker CE
    - Instructions can be found here: https://docs.docker.com/install/

- We only officially support Ubuntu. Install the following packages:
   ```
   sudo apt update && apt-get -y install build-essential git wget cmake \
  libssl-dev libgmp-dev autoconf libtool
   ```

- Install `node > v13.0`. We typically recommend using `n`

- You will need python 3 and then run
    - `make deps`

- This project requires Ledger firmware 2.0
    - The current repository keeps track of Ledger's SDK but it is possible to override it by changing the git submodule.

*Warning*: Some IDEs may not use the same python interpreter or virtual enviroment as the one you used when running `pip`.
If you see conan is not found, check that you installed the package in the same interpreter as the one that launches `cmake`.

## How to build ?

> We like clion or vscode but let's have some reproducible command line steps
>

- Building the app itself

    If you installed the what is described above, just run:
    ```bash
    make
    ```

## Running tests

- Running rust tests (x64)

    If you installed the what is described above, just run:
    ```bash
    make rust_test
    ```

- Running C/C++ tests (x64)

    If you installed the what is described above, just run:
    ```bash
    make cpp_test
    ```

- Running device emulation+integration tests!!

   ```bash
    Use Zemu! Explained below!
    ```

## How to test with Zemu?

First, install everything:
> At this moment, if you change the app you will need to run `make` before running the test again.

```bash
make zemu_install
```

Then you can run JS tests:

```bash
make zemu_test
```

To run a single specific test:

> At the moment, the recommendation is to run from the IDE. Remember to run `make` if you change the app.

## Using a real device

### How to prepare your DEVELOPMENT! device:

>  You can use an emulated device for development. This is only required if you are using a physical device
>
>    **Please do not use a Ledger device with funds for development purposes.**
>>
>    **Have a separate and marked device that is used ONLY for development and testing**

   There are a few additional steps that increase reproducibility and simplify development:

**1 - Ensure your device works in your OS**
- In Linux hosts it might be necessary to adjust udev rules, etc.

  Refer to Ledger documentation: https://support.ledger.com/hc/en-us/articles/115005165269-Fix-connection-issues

**2 - Set a test mnemonic**

Many of our integration tests expect the device to be configured with a known test mnemonic.

- Plug your device while pressing the right button

- Your device will show "Recovery" in the screen

- Double click

- Run `make dev_init`. This will take about 2 minutes. The device will be initialized to:

   ```
   PIN: 5555
   Mnemonic: equip will roof matter pink blind book anxiety banner elbow sun young
   ```

**3 - Add a development certificate**

- Plug your device while pressing the right button

- Your device will show "Recovery" in the screen

- Click both buttons at the same time

- Enter your pin if necessary

- Run `make dev_ca`. The device will receive a development certificate to avoid constant manual confirmations.


### Loading into your development device

To easily setup a development environment for compilation and loading on a physical device, you can use the [VSCode integration](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=LedgerHQ.ledger-dev-tools) whether you are on Linux, macOS or Windows.

If you prefer using a terminal to perform the steps manually, you can do the following:

The Makefile will build the firmware in a docker container and leave the binary in the correct directory.

- Build

   ```
   make                # Builds the app
   ```

- Upload to a device
   The following commands will upload the application to the ledger. _Warning: The application will be deleted before uploading._
   ```
   make shellS          # Or shellS2, shellX
   make load
   ```
